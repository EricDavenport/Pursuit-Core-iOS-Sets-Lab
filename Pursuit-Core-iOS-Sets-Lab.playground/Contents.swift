// Uncomment the "assert" lines for each problem when you have a solution, and run the playground to test.  When you have uncommented out the assert lines, no error messages or print statements means that your code is working correctly.

// Question One

// Create a new array numbersWithNoDuplicates that has all of the elements from numbers without any duplicates.  It should be in the same order as the original.

let numbers = [1,1,2,4,4,4,6,6,7,8]

// Questions Two

// Create a new array scoresThatAppearOnce that has all the elements from scores that appear exactly once.  It should be in the same order as the original.

// Question Three

// a.

// Given arrOne and arrTwo, create a variable arrThree which is equal to the UNION of arrOne and arrTwo.  It should not contain any duplicate elements.  Sort arrThree from smallest to greatest.

// Question Four

// Question Five

// Determine if a String is a pangram. A pangram is a string that contains every letter of the alphabet at least once.
